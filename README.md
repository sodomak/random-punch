# Random Punch

[ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ ÄŒeskÃ¡ verze](README_CS.md)

A training app for MMA/boxing that helps athletes practice techniques and combinations through random number displays.

## Installation

### Android
1. Download the APK file from the [latest release](https://github.com/sodomak/random-punch/releases/latest)
2. On your Android device, tap the downloaded APK file
3. If prompted, allow installation from unknown sources
   - You may see a security warning about installing apps from unknown sources
   - This is normal for apps installed outside of Google Play Store
   - If needed, go to Settings > Security and enable "Install from unknown sources" or "Install unknown apps" for your browser
4. Follow the Android installation prompts
5. Once installed, you can find "Random Punch" in your app drawer

**Note about security warnings:** When installing, you may see a Google Play Protect warning saying "Unsafe app blocked" or that it "doesn't recognize this app's developer". This is normal for apps installed outside of Google Play Store and doesn't indicate a problem with the app. To proceed with installation:
1. When the warning appears, tap "More details"
2. Choose "Install anyway" to continue with installation
3. If asked about sending app for scanning, you can choose either option - this is optional and won't affect the app's functionality

Alternatively, you can install via [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium).

Note: The app is currently available for Android only.
